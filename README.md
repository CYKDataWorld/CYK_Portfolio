# [Project 1: Analysis of factors that affect startup success](https://github.com/CYKDataWorld/CYK_Portfolio/blob/main/Final%20Project.pdf)
* What are the important factors that influence the success of a startup? Could the location, founding year, market, etc. be relevant also?
* The original dataset has 49438 observations of 39 variables. We cleaned the dataset and removed the null values resulting in a dataset of 21840 observations. 
* We further cleaned the dataset to focus our efforts on specific features that matched our problem definition resulting in 19 variables.
* In this graph we have the percentages of the top markets. The top 3 markets are : Software, Biotechnology and Mobile.
* We have the peak time period for startups during the time period 2011-2012.
* The top 3 states with the most startups are California, New York and Massachusetts.
* Findings: The dataset we used is for a classification problem. In order to do regression analysis, this dataset needs to be extended with more continuous data to   boost support of the Chi Square test results.
